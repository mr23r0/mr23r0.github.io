"Adaptive Web Design" by [Aaron Gustafson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarongustafson){:target="_blank"} explains how to build websites that work well on all devices by focusing on accessibility, usability, and flexibility. For security researchers, it shows how designing with these principles can help reduce security risks, make websites more reliable, and improve user safety. A great read for anyone interested in the connection between web design and security. (something that I found very interesting and useful, your opinion may vary)
